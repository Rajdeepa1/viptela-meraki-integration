# Viptela Meraki Integration

# Objective 

*   How to use Zscaler APIs to create VPN endpoints and locations.
*   How to use vManage REST APIs to configure IPsec tunnel from  vEdge router to Zscaler VPN endpoints. 


# Requirements

To use this code you will need:

* Python 3.7+
* vManage user login details. (User should have privilege level to configure feature templates and edit device template)
* vEdge routers with device template attached.
* Zscaler login and API key details. (User should be part of partner admin group)
* Refer https://help.zscaler.com/zia/api-getting-started for documentation on how to enable API subscription for your Zscaler account

# Install and Setup

- Clone the code to local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/suchandanreddy/zscaler-ipsec-tunnel.git
cd zscaler-ipsec-tunnel
```
- Setup Python Virtual Environment (requires Python 3.7+)

```
python3.7 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

- Create config_details.yaml using below sample format to update the environment variables for vManage, Zscaler login details and tunnel parameters

## Example:

```
# vManage Connectivity Info
vmanage_host: 
vmanage_port: 
vmanage_username: 
vmanage_password: 


# Zscaler Connectivity Info
zscaler_cloud: 
api_key: 
zscaler_username: 
zscaler_password:

# Device template Info

device_template_name:

# IPsec route prefix for all Service VPNs

#service_vpn_ipsec_route:  0.0.0.0/0

# Network Routers
devices:
  - system_ip: 
    vpn0_source_interface: 
    #local_id_domain: cisco.com

#dummy /30 private ip address for IPsec tunnel

    #pri_ipsec_ip: 10.10.10.1/30
    #sec_ipsec_ip: 10.10.10.5/30
    #pri_ipsec_id: ipsec254
    #sec_ipsec_id: ipsec255
    #psk: ""
    #local_id: ""
    #location_name: ""

  - system_ip: 
    vpn0_source_interface: 
    #local_id_domain: viptela.com

#dummy /30 private ip address for IPsec tunnel

    #pri_ipsec_ip: 10.10.10.1/30
    #sec_ipsec_ip: 10.10.10.5/30
    #pri_ipsec_id: ipsec254
    #sec_ipsec_id: ipsec255
    #psk: ""
    #local_id: ""
    #location_name: ""
```

After setting the env variables, run the python script `zscaler-ipsec-tunnel.py`

`zscaler-ipsec-tunnel.py` script does the below steps in sequence. 

## Workflow

### Automation using vManage APIs:

- Get source ip address of the tunnel source interface on vEdge Routers

### Automation using Zscaler APIs: 

- Using the tunnel source ip address, retrieve the nearest zscaler cloud endpoint IP addresses using the zscaler API `/pac.<zscaler-cloud-name>/getVpnEndpoints?srcIp=`
- Create VPN endpoint on zscaler using API `/admin.<zscaler-cloud-name>/api/v1/vpnCredentials`
- Create location using API `/admin.<zscaler-cloud-name>/api/v1/locations` and bind it to the VPN endpoint created in above step. 
- Default location name is `hostname + location city name based on Public IP`
- Default local id is `hostname + uuid + @cisco.com`
- Zscaler VPN endpoints and locations are created for IPsec tunnels from each vEdge router

### Automation using vManage APIs:

- Fetch the device template-id associated with the device template name. 
- Retrieve feature templates associated with this device template. 
- Create 2 IPsec feature templates with device specific variables for Zscaler primary and secondary tunnels.
- Attach the new IPsec feature templates to device templates. 
- Add the device specific variables values for IPsec tunnel source interface, tunnel ip address, tunnel destination address, local-id, remote-id, pre-shared key.
- Push the updated template to all the devices attached to the Device template.
- By end of the script, 2 zscaler tunnels(primary and secondary) would be configured to the nearest Zscaler VPN endpoint from each vEdge router which is attached to the device template. 
- Create IPsec route in all service VPNs. By default we create default IPsec route in service VPN but destination prefix for IPsec route can be modified using variable `service_vpn_ipsec_route` in config_details.yaml

## Restrictions

- Default dummy IP addresses used for tunnels are 10.10.10.1/30 (for primary) and 10.10.10.5/30 (for secondary) , can be changed using `config_details.yaml` variables `pri_ipsec_ip` and `sec_ipsec_ip` if there is overlapping address with other interfaces in VPN 0
- vEdge should be in vManage mode with device template attached which contains VPN 0 feature template and at least one VPN 0 interface which can be used as source interface for the IPsec tunnel. 
- Script creates IPsec feature templates with names **Device Template name** + `_zscaler_ipsec_primary` and **Device Template name** + `_zscaler_ipsec_secondary` so, there shouldn't pre-configured IPsec feature templates with this name. If needed, we can change the code to create IPsec feature templates with alternative name.

# viptela-meraki-integration

This toolkit enables Meraki and Umbrella customers to streamline always on connectivity from a Cisco Meraki Branch site to Cisco Viptela Vedge. Extending secure and automated connectivity to between Cisco Meraki Branch sites and Vedge Hubs.

# Architecture

![Test Image 1](viptela_meraki_architecture.png)

1) Obtain Cisco Meraki API Key and Org Name

    a) The API Key and Org Name will be needed for the script to configure your Meraki device. 

    b) To view your Organization name navigate to Organization > Settings, the name will be displayed at the top. (As seen below)
    
    c) For access to the API, first enable the API for your organization. 

    d) Navigate to Organization > Settings > Dashboard API access 

    e) Enable the API 
    
    f) Navigate to the my profile page and generate an API key 

     Note: The API key is associated with a Dashboard administrator account. â€¯ 

# Cisco Meraki Workflow 

Initially, there will be no tagged Meraki networks so the script will sleep and perform the same GET to obtain any networks with the relevant tag. In order to deploy a new branch, the user would navigate to Organization > Overview and select the checkbox next to the network that you wish to connect. 

Once the network is tagged appropriately, connectivity is then automatically established. A customer VPN tunnel in the Umbrella dashboard is created with a matching network name to that of the Meraki branch. Site1 will be named Site1 in both the Vmanage and Meraki dashboard. Additionally, a site to site VPN will appear on the site to site VPN page. (As seen below)

Note: The script also assumes VPN is already turned on for the specific MX. For the tunnel to come up, interesting traffic needs to be generated.

Once interesting traffic has been generated, the tunnel will appear up in both the Meraki and Vmanage Dashboards:

Additionally, in the Meraki Event Log, a event with a timestamp is generated when the tunnel becomes established:
